# odin-recipes
 As the project is named will build a website that  will be focusing on "recipes" 
 it is mostly a begginer website and it will grow as per learning(progress) 
 later on once am on intermediate level will finalise and add javascript to make it 
 interactive with users.
 I will start the project by demonstrating the skill on HTML then css lately 
 I will finilise with javaScript
